// SPACE DATA EXERCISE 6
// Return an array with all asteroids discovered after a given year

import { Asteroid } from "../data/data";

export function getAsteroidsDiscoveredAfterYear(asteroids: Asteroid[], year: number) {

}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-6"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
