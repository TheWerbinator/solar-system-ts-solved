// SPACE DATA EXERCISE 7
// Return an array of all Planets names that have moons

import { Planet } from "../data/data";

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-7"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
